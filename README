This is a sample project to demonstrate how to use the ElasticSearch Java API's.

This project uses the following:
- dropwizard 0.8
- Swagger 2.0
- Java 7
- ElasticSearch Java API 

It has been tested with ElasticSearch v1.5.2.

Many thanks to [federecio](https://github.com/federecio) for the [dropwizard-swagger](https://github.com/federecio/dropwizard-swagger) bundle. It saves a lot of time
in integrating between dropwizard and swagger.
